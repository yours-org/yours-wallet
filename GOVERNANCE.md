## Project Governance Structure

#### Project Lead:

- Responsible for overall project direction and decision-making.
- Appoints maintainers and contributors.
- Final authority in case of disputes or critical decisions.

#### Maintainers:

- Responsible for reviewing and merging code contributions.
- Oversee project documentation and issue management.
- Act as a bridge between contributors and the project lead.

#### Contributors:

- Individuals who actively contribute to the project through code, documentation, or other means.
- Submit pull requests and participate in issue discussions.

#### Community:

- All users and stakeholders of the project who provide feedback, report issues, and suggest improvements.
- Engage in discussions and offer insights to help shape the project.

#### Decision-Making Process:

**Issues and Features:** Contributors and the community can [Create an issue](https://github.com/Panda-Wallet/panda-wallet/issues) and track the [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/Panda-Wallet/projects/1) to propose new features, discuss improvements, or report bugs. All PRs will require at least one approval from the Project Lead or a Maintainers.

#### Pull Requests:

- Contributors can submit pull requests for code changes or enhancements. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Discussion:

- All significant decisions will be discussed openly. Contributors and maintainers can discuss issues and pull requests in the project's communication channels (e.g., GitHub discussions, mailing list, or other platforms).

#### Consensus:

- Decisions will ideally be made through consensus. If there is a dispute, the project lead has the final say.

#### Roadmap:

- The project lead, with input from maintainers and the community, will maintain a roadmap outlining the project's future goals and direction.

#### Communication:

- All communications related to code changes will happen within the GitHub repo or in the public [Discord](https://discord.gg/qHs6hTkmsf).
